## Starting from Scratch
### Basic idea: 
I wanted to create a map app that allow users to find the top restaurants in Charlottesville, VA. They can filter the results according to Yelp restaurant rating, distance from their current locations, and the type of food they want to eat. So I sketch the UI design for both the mobile and desktop versions:
