## How to use

 - 

## Starting from Scratch
### Basic idea: 
I wanted to create a map app that allow users to find top restaurants in Charlottesville, VA. They can filter the results according to Yelp restaurant rating, distance from their current locations, and the type of food they want to eat. So I sketched the early UI planning and features for both the mobile and desktop versions.

 - Instantly show you a list of restaurants with 4+ stars reviews on Yelp
 - Give directions based on your choices of transportation and duration
 - Enter key words to search for restaurants 
 - Change the rating filter
 - Click on the restaurant's marker to present an info-window
 - Info-window shows restaurant information and a photo its street view
